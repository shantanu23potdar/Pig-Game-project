# Pig-Game-project

Pig is a simple dice game.

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
## The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
